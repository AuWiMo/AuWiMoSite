Link Spell Names to Songs!

All you need to do is enter a YouTube URL into the "Enter YouTube URL" box
Then click "Start Casting" and the video's audio will start playing at the specified timecode (in YouTube's url?t={time in seconds} format), or at the beginning if a timecode was not specified.

Edit a spell name or url/timecode by clicking "Edit" on the spell you want to edit.
Delete a spell by clicking "Edit" and then "Delete". There is no confirmation popup and this is irreversible (aside from being easily re-setup). 
Create a new spell by clicking "New Song"

If you are not using an ad blocker, you may experience the audio of ads playing instead. I recommend you install 'Adblock Plus' for Chrome users, other browsers should have their own suitable ad blockers.  

Your data will be saved to your browser local storage so that it persists between sessions. If you need to start over, simply clear the site data.
If people like this tool I will be adding a way to have multiple different Bards added and deleted so sets of Spells can be managed easier
